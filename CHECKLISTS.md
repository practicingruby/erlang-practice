## Preliminaries

```
[X] Get a working Erlang installation
[X] Use the REPL
[X] Run programs from command line
[X] Read a stack trace
[X] Print some inspect output
[X] Write a unit test
[ ] Investigate the testing frameworks available in Erlang
[ ] Try out some debugging tools
[X] Read PE Ch 1
[X] Read PE Ch 2
[X] Read PE Ch 3
[X] Read PE Ch 4
[X] Do PE Ch 2 exercises
[X] Do PE Ch 3 exercises
[ ] Do PE Ch 4 exercises
[X] Learn the different statement separators (. , ;)
[ ] Figure out what a "function clause" is... does that
    mean a whole function, anything between punctuation, etc?
[ ] Understand the different use cases for Tuples, Lists, Maps, etc.
[ ] Write a small toy program to practice all of the above
    (Maybe solve a code kata?)
[ ] Write up an explanation of why these preliminaries were important
    (basically can't do 'real practice' until you have minimal proficiency
     -- you don't want to be stumbling constantly with syntax errors
     and trivial documentation lookups about basic features.
     Also, stress importance of a good intro resource or book.
     Note that I had a head start on Erlang from dabbling with it
     in the past, but the process would be the same, just slower
     if I hadn't. Also note how I treated most examples as exercises)
[ ] Establish a daily practice routine checklist
```

## Miscellaneous

```
[ ] Create a glossary of important Erlang terms
[ ] Make a list of features from Erlang that are missing in Ruby,
    and vice-versa. (Skim PE to refresh memory, as well as journal notes)
```

## Projects

```
[ ] Implement the Dining Philosophers problem
[ ] Implement the rover IRC bot game
```
