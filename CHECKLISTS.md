## Daily Practice Routine

1. Work on exercises (30 mins)

Make sure to have these ready the night before, pick stuff
that you can work on right away without having to study 
in advance. They can either be book exercises or stuff
from other sources, but they should be 
self-verifiable for correctness. Goal is not to finish
but just to learn as much as possible.

2. Work through book reading and book exercises (90 mins)

Jumping around chapters is OK, but reading whole chapters
at a time is encouraged. Read what is most related to
the projects you're working on.

3. Work on projects (90 mins)

Start with bowling score calculator, then dining philosophers,
then IRC rover bot if time permits. Focus on getting working
code first, before worrying about correct code. But once you
have a working solution, figure out how to make it right,
and get help if necessary for style questions.

4. Prepare questions, TODO lists, and exercises for the next
day. Reflect on what was learned today. (30 mins)

## Preliminaries

```
[X] Get a working Erlang installation
[X] Use the REPL

[X] Read a stack trace
[X] Print some inspect output
[X] Write a unit test

[X] Learn the different statement separators (. , ;)
[X] Figure out what a "function clause" is... does that
    mean a whole function, anything between punctuation, etc?
[X] Understand the different use cases for Tuples, Lists, Maps, etc.
[ ] Write a small toy program to practice all of the above
    (Maybe solve a code kata?)

[X] Establish a daily practice routine checklist
```

## Miscellaneous

```
[ ] Create a glossary of important Erlang terms
[ ] Make a list of features from Erlang that are missing in Ruby,
    and vice-versa. (Skim PE to refresh memory, as well as journal notes)
[ ] Write up an explanation of why preliminaries were important
    (basically can't do 'real practice' until you have minimal proficiency
     -- you don't want to be stumbling constantly with syntax errors
     and trivial documentation lookups about basic features.
     Also, stress importance of a good intro resource or book.
     Note that I had a head start on Erlang from dabbling with it
     in the past, but the process would be the same, just slower
     if I hadn't. Also note how I treated most examples as exercises,
     also note about asking for help)
